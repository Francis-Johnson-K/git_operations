The tool shown in the image is Git Gui, a lightweight graphical user interface for Git. It is a cross-platform tool included with Git distributions, designed to provide a visual way to perform common Git operations without needing to use the command line. Below, I’ll explain everything from Git Gui’s perspective, adapting the step-by-step Git operations guide previously provided to focus on using this tool.

Overview of Git Gui
Purpose: Git Gui simplifies Git operations like cloning, committing, branching, merging, and more through a graphical interface.
Features: It supports basic repository management, staging and committing changes, viewing history, and simple branch operations. However, it lacks advanced features like rebasing or cherry-picking, which may require command-line use or other GUI tools.
Interface: The image shows the "Clone Existing Repository" dialog, indicating Git Gui’s capability to initialize a local copy of a remote repository.
1. Setting Up Git Gui
Installation: Git Gui comes with Git. Install Git from git-scm.com, and Git Gui is available automatically.
Launch: Open Git Gui from your system (e.g., via terminal with git gui or from the Start menu on Windows).
Configuration: Set your name and email via the command line first (e.g., git config --global user.name "Your Name"), as Git Gui does not handle initial configuration directly.
2. Initializing a Repository

Clone an Existing Repository
Steps in Git Gui:
Launch Git Gui.
Click "Clone Existing Repository" (as shown in the image).
Source Location: Enter the URL of the remote repository (e.g., https://github.com/user/repo.git) or use "Browse" to select a local repository.
Target Directory: Specify the local folder path or use "Browse" to choose a destination.
Clone Type:
Standard (Fast, Semi-Redundant, Hardlinks): Default, efficient option.
Full Copy (Slower, Redundant Backup): Creates a complete duplicate.
Shared (Fastest, Not Recommended, No Backup): Uses file system links, risky for backups.
Recursively Clone Submodules Too: Check this box (as shown) to include submodules.
Click "Clone" to create the local repository.
Outcome: A new local repository is set up, and Git Gui opens it for further operations.
Create a New Repository
Git Gui does not support creating a new repository directly. Use the command line (git init) in the target directory, then open it with Git Gui.
3. Basic Git Workflow
Check Status: Git Gui’s main window shows uncommitted changes in the "Unstaged Changes" and "Staged Changes" panes.
Stage Changes: Right-click files in "Unstaged Changes," select "Stage to Commit," or drag them to the "Staged Changes" area.
Commit Changes: Enter a commit message in the text box at the bottom, then click "Commit."
Push to Remote: Go to "Remote > Push," select the branch (e.g., main), and click "Push."
Pull Updates: Go to "Remote > Fetch from > origin," then "Merge > Local Merge" to integrate changes.
4. Branching
Create a Branch: Go to "Branch > Create," enter a branch name (e.g., feature-branch), and click "Create."
Switch to a Branch: Go to "Branch > Checkout," select the branch, and click "Checkout."
List Branches: View branches in the "Branch" menu.
Merge a Branch: Checkout the target branch (e.g., main), go to "Merge > Local Merge," select the branch to merge (e.g., feature-branch), and click "Merge."
Delete a Branch: Go to "Branch > Delete," select the branch, and confirm.
